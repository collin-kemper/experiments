# Some Experiments On Neural Nets

`param-trajectory.py` shows how the fractal dimension of the trajectory that
the model parameters take through parameter space while being optimized varies
with different optimization algorithms. Somewhat expectedly, SGD has notably
higher fractal dimension than Adam-style optimization algorithms.
